# Linux Command Cheat Sheet 

https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000798.htm

# To remove a directory that contains other files or directories, use the following command.
rm -r mydir

# Executing the above command would delete all files and directories in the directory named 
# in the command. However, it would also present a prompt for approval to delete each of the files. If you don't want to receive a prompt for each file, use the following command instead.

rm -rf mydir

In the example above, the "mydir" directory, along with all files and directories in that directory, would be deleted with no prompt or message.
